# Mbed OS example for Arduino BLE 33 board
Arduino had been chosen Mbed OS on their Arduino BLE 33 product on last July.([LINK](https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/07/31/why-we-chose-to-build-the-arduino-nano-33-ble-core-on-mbed-os/)) This example is a simple use case of Mbed OS on Arduino BLE 33.

**Tested Arduino IDE only*

See [here](https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-mbed-rtos-features-on-the-arduino-nano-33-ble) for Arduino setup and getting started guide, and I've referenced some code.

**Note that Mbed CLI is not support to Arduino BLE 33 board. Because, Arduino BLE 33 board is not include [DAPLink I/F](https://os.mbed.com/handbook/DAPLink)*
